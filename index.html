      The croissant, today a symbol of French baking, actually has its origins
      in Austria. The pastry's history dates back to the 17th century, with a
      connection to the **Austrian kipferl**, a crescent-shaped pastry that was
      popular in Vienna. The most widely accepted story of the croissant's
      invention involves the 1683 **Battle of Vienna**. According to legend,
      when the Ottoman Turks laid siege to the city, Viennese bakers created the
      crescent-shaped pastry to celebrate the defeat of the invaders,
      symbolizing the crescent moon on the Turkish flag. In the 19th century,
      the pastry made its way to France, where it was popularized by **Marie
      Antoinette**. She was Austrian and is said to have introduced the kipferl
      to the French court, where it evolved into the more refined, flaky version
      we recognize as the croissant today. By the early 20th century, the
      croissant had become a staple of French breakfasts, thanks to the
      introduction of laminated dough (layers of butter and dough) by French
      bakers, which gave the pastry its signature flaky texture. Today, the
      croissant is a beloved part of French cuisine and has become popular
      worldwide.
